# intro

I had a lot of fun learning about and playing with git, I can see it being incredibly useful in the future. And I can't wait to see this save
my skin when I'm working on the project.

I need to remember the formatting for the git commands, they are

git add "file name"
git pull
git commit -m "text here"
git push
git status

I have been playing around with HTML, it is important to remember the formating that the code inputs needs to be so that the browser understands what you want properly.

(for my notes) <a href="link.here"> example text </a>

I was messing around with simon, I learned about how scripts can be used in computers to accomplish tasks without having to run it through an editor, straight from the command line. super cool.

after working through a significant portion of the html for my startup, I realized how intuitive the designing of the base foundation of the website.
this makes me worried about what might happen if I tried to actually make it look pretty and have the sleek nature I'd hope to find in an actual game.

we are learning CSS, I'm amazed at how "simple" the language is. Yet it's complexity is insane.

use <meta name="viewport" /> so that a website doesn't try to adapt a page for you.

@media (orientation: portrait) {
    div {
        transform: rotate(270deg);
    }
}

float is used to force some objects on the side you dictate instead of automatically loading it on the left.

this next method is used to help automatically resize and move objects in websites so they render automatically.
## This is grid

.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns:
        repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));
    grid-auto-rows: 300px;
    grid-gap: 1em;
}

flex

## This is flex

body {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    margin: 0;
    height: 100vh;
}

I was experimenting with the simon css elements before pushing the css code onto simon on my browser. I realized that bootstrap mainly looks like html, but the classes that you decide to associate with every element and peice of the objects and format you create is how you directly influence the appearance of the document. It makes much more sense to me now.

# May 15-17

I managed to teach myself better techniques for the flex style method.
Big notes: pay attention to what overrides the formatting in the documents, if a link to another css file is being imported at the top of the document, it will be used as the default instead of any edit attmepts made inside the rest of the files.
if you aren't sure what can be used as an argument for a line of code, delete the ":" and replace it to see recommended inputs.
if all else fails, look it up or review old code you wrote.

in JS, "extends" in class Beach extends location tells the Beach class to inherit location.

classes don't need to have 'function' written in front of a function declaration because it already assumes you are making a function in the class.

you can use the #document command in any websites debugger to see its HTML, then we can make sqripts and code that can do anything we want with the page.

there are many ways to register events and changes to code for the javascript to run off.

'this' on a global function is undefined. otherwise it would be the window.
