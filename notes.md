# intro

I had a lot of fun learning about and playing with git, I can see it being incredibly useful in the future. And I can't wait to see this save
my skin when I'm working on the project.

I need to remember the formatting for the git commands, they are

git add "file name"
git pull
git commit -m "text here"
git push
git status
