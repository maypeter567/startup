I need to get busy.

I need to be constantly updating my README.md so that it accurately reflects what I've been doing with my assignment.

we are starting class.

about.blank lets you make an empty document in the chrome browser. command f12 brings up the debugging and developer tools.

index.html is a default page that a website navigates to whenever a page is loaded.
