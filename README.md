## Elevator Pitch.

With the game Mafia as my inspiration, I will create a simple platform to automatically generate a murder mystery game that will process and record all decisions and interactions every turn. I have often found that Mafia, and its variations, can get very confusing for the narrator when there are more than 5 players. This site will remove the confusion that follows creating any game, increasing the potential player capacity beyond normal means. This change will allow any number of people to play together quickly, drastically decreasing the wait time between turns and increasing the fun of the game. additional benefits include more random role results, reliable game results, and customized loss or victory messages for the players.
